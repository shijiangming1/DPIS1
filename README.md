# Dual Pseudo-Labels Interactive Self-Training for Semi-Supervised Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification ICCV2023

## Contribution
1. We propose a dual pseudo-label interactive self-training framework for semi-supervised visible-infrared person Re-ID, which leverages the intro- and inter-modality characteristics to obtain hybrid pseudo-labels.
2. We introduce three modules: noise label penalty (NLP), noise correspondence calibration (NCC), and unreliable anchor learning (UAL). These modules help to penalize noise labels, calibrate noisy correspondences, and exploit hard-to-discriminate features.
3. We provide comprehensive evaluations under these two semi-supervised VI-ReID. Extensive experiments on two popular VI-ReID benchmarks demonstrate that our DPIS achieves impressive performance.
